# Supernova-testnet

Today I'm going to  show you how I started a new testnet and finished it very quickly. As ussual all detailed guide is here [supernova](https://medium.com/supernovazone/how-to-drink-champagne-eac89625330). The guide invites us to connect the Kepler wallet and swap their exchange. Bugs describe in Google form and also check the ‘Stake’ stuffs. 

I opened the website, add Keplet wallet and .. that's all.. It's **Failed to fetch** error. Ok, there is an error. But the wallet seems to be connected. 
But it only seems. Drop Down wallet menu does not work. and I can’t swap the exchange. 

**Website errors**<br/>

What did I write about in google form?<br/>
It is quite inconvenient to write a bug report in Google form. But I tried. Of the important components, I highlighted the environment (Chrome browser), steps to reproduce, and the actual result. And screenshots of course. <br/>
**Summary**: Errors after Kepler wallet added. **Environment** : Google chrom 106.0.5249.119. **Steps to reproduce** : 1. Open website supernova. 2. Add Kepler wallet. **Actual result** Failed fetch error. <br/> 

**Summary2**: Drop down menu doesn't work. 1. Click on an icon Kepler wallet. **Expected result**: wallet ballance open in drop down menu.**Actual result**: Drop down menu does not react. <br/>

Sometimes the testnet ends before it starts, when the most important functionality of the exchange (connect a wallet, start exchanging tokens) does not work. Supernova released a very raw testnet. I think they will fix everything, and I will write a sequel ;)
